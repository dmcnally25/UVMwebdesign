        <p> One of my earliest, most genuine hobbies or passions has been kung fu.  I first became captivated by Chinese
            kung fu by watching martial arts movies on Saturday's "Kung Fu Theater".  This was a regular occurrence that
            I looked forward to every week.  The plots were less than captivating, but often had a general moral message around 
            themes of - humility, hard-work, patience, persistence, justice, fairness, humbleness, and mastery.  They inspired me
            with their characters' acrobatics, athleticism, philosophy, and principles focus.  I was hooked!  Immediately, I began 
            a one or two year quest looking in the phone book, want ads, etc. for a kung fu school.  This was no where to be found
            in my southern, rural town.  
        </p>
        <p> 
            I began making treks to the local mall in New Orleans whenever my parents took us there (20 mile drive away)
            to puruse the book stores for kung fu books.  After about one year of collecting books, trying to poorly teach myself kung fu, and 
            general adolescent exasperation, I had a break through as if manifested from heaven.  At my neighborhood bus stop for school, 
            there was another student wearing a jacket with a kung fu school logo emblazened upon the back.  It was a sign from the universe.
            I quickly walked up to the guy, got the school info and contact, and made my first call to set up a visit.  I can still recall that first lesson
            very clearly in my mind's eye.

        <h2 style="background-color:rgb(145, 209, 198);">My First Kung Fu Class</h2>
        <p> My kung fu teacher taught for several years from a converted garage attached to the back of his family's house.  He 
            lived on the opposite side of town, closer to Lake Pontchartrain and the faint echoes of New Orlean transplant families.  
            I recall walking into the door and there it was - a class full of students all in black pants, black t-shirts, belts of 
            every color, doing forms, kicks, stretches, etc.  It looked interesting.  I was quietly skeptical.  Where were the Chinese 
            masters? the amazing superhuman skills? the mystical secrets?  I told myself to be patient and took a seat along the lone bench 
            where some other adults (parents) were sitting and chatting.  
        </p>
         <p>
            As I watched the class practice, all of a sudden, a large
            man who was sitting next to me dressed in ordinary pants and a tshirt quickly got up and said, "All right knuckleheads, let me
            show y'all something".  Little did I know that the unassuming man was to turn out to be my future Grandmaster (Sigung Norman Pedelahore). He paused 
            the class and seemlessly took some move they were working on and began to demonstrate a seemingly endless variety of applications 
            of the movements.  He moved with a speed, lightness, and precision that seemed impossible given his large frame, and his 
            presence seemed to fill up the space of the entire garage.  The whirlwind of movement and effortless control left me dumbfounded.  
            I was ready to sign up at that instant.  I knew somewhere deep in my being that I had finally found what I had been looking for!
