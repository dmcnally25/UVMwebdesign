This is the README file for my website.
The purpose of this website is to share some of my passion for kung fu, a martial art I have practiced
for more than 40 years.  I have gained a lot of benefit from this art and wish to honor and celebrate it through this website.

Key features of this website include:
    The main page html - "index.html".
    The external CSS style file - "style.css"
    Three additional webpages - "intro.html, history.html, and forms.html"
    Finally, supporting images are included in the .zip file for this project.

I hope you enjoy.
